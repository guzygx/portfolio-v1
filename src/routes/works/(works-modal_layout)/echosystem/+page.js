        hyperbolization of a high-traffic zone (in this case, a school staircase).`,
        description_2: `In the same way thatwe only become aware of our bodies when they fall ill, the project performs a discreet
        parasitization that contaminates the reverberation and lighting of a busy area through minimal
        intervention - only a microphone and a few solenoids bear witness to the intervention in
        progress. By continuously capturing sounds, the device acts as the sonic memory of the place,
        recording the events that traumatize it - slamming doors, laughter, screams, ... - only to play
        them back reactively and asynchronously, like a paradoxical echo that turns the past into a
        repetition of the present. The site's lighting is infected too. Artificial light sources,
        usually so stable and functional they become invisible, also repeat the memory of the place in a
        loop; it's only when they lose their utilitarian, invisibilizing function that they become
        worthy of our attention. Lastly, the system's global cognition acts with solenoids distributed
        throughout the space, which are punching the space when the activity threshold approaches a
        critical level. In the event of audible and visual saturation, a purge-reset system is
        activated. The architecture, overstimulated by memories replayed and amplified in a deafening
        feedback loop, finds temporary salvation in unconsciousness and oblivion.`
