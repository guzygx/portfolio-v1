        description_1: `Ec(h)osystem is a transmedia installation investigating the sensitive
        hyperbolization of a high-traffic zone (in this case, a school staircase).`,
        description_2: `In the same way that we only become aware of our bodies when they fall ill, the project performs a discreet
        parasitization that contaminates the reverberation and lighting of a busy area through minimal
        intervention - only a microphone and a few solenoids bear witness to the intervention in
        progress. By continuously capturing sounds, the system acts as the sonic memory of the place,
        recording the events that traumatize it - slamming doors, laughter, screams, ... - only to play
        them back reactively and asynchronously, like a paradoxical echo that turns the past into a
        repetition of the present.`,
        description_3: `The site's lighting is infected too: artificial light sources,
        usually so stable and functional they become invisible, blink to the rythm of the noises that haunt the place.
        It's only when they lose their utilitarian, invisibilizing function that places and objects become
        worthy of our attention, as demonstrated the distributed solenoids punching the walls 
        when the activity threshold approaches a critical level. 
        In the event of audible and visual saturation, a purge-reset system is activated: 
        the architecture, overstimulated by memories replayed and amplified in a deafening
        feedback loop, finds temporary salvation in unconsciousness and oblivion.`
