        But what does it mean to disappear on the Internet?`,
        description_2: `Some have mysteriously abandoned their channel. One is in prison for horrible crimes, another has become a mother. Most have
        died, either tragically or naturally. What all these youtubers had in common was that they all produced music, 
        often covers, sometimes original compositions. All were singers. Inspired by the pedestals found in video games that 
        give the player an extra life, this installation invites its viewer to move its black heart into space, 
        so that the voices of the dead and the missing mingle together in new, unexpected ways. 
        The heart's different axes of rotation allow to explore different ways of knotting the voices of the dead and making them sing together. 
        Neither nostalgic homage nor macabre archiving, GhostSong is above all a joyful questioning of our relationship with abandoned data and 
        its capacity to weave new worlds in which oblivion and destruction are also playful and creative forces.`,
